# PRICE OPTIMIZATION AND DEMAND FORECASTING FOR PROFITABILITY IN RETAIL

## About the Dataset

### **Context**  
Price optimization involves analyzing historical data to determine the most appropriate pricing for a product or service, ultimately maximizing a company’s profitability. Several factors influence efficient pricing, including:  
- **Demographics**: Understanding customer segments and their willingness to pay.  
- **Operating Costs**: Considering production, distribution, and overhead costs.  
- **Survey Data**: Incorporating customer feedback and competitive benchmarks.  
- **Business and Product Nature**: Tailoring strategies based on the type of business and the value offered by the product.  

Businesses frequently enhance their products by adding or upgrading features, which incurs costs in terms of effort, time, and, importantly, the company’s reputation. Therefore, determining the correct pricing is critical:  
- **Overpricing Risks**: Losing customers to competitors.  
- **Underpricing Risks**: Eroding revenue and diminishing perceived value.  

Price optimization helps businesses achieve an effective balance by aligning pricing strategies with profitability goals while delivering value to customers.
